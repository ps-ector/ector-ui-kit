# Ector UI KIT

This page is a collection of all the components that are available in the Ector UI KIT.

## How to use it

You can use it in 2 ways, if your project has Tailwind installed you can just copy/paste the HTML code of the component you want to use to avoid any overhead.

Other way is to install the package

```bash
npm i @ps-ector/ector-ui-kit
```

and then import the component you want to use

```js
import { Button } from "@ps-ector/ector-ui-kit";
```

In second method you wont have to import the CSS as it is already included in the package, but if your project already uses Tailwind you got a little overhead of duplicated generated classes, we suggest you to use the first method in this case.
